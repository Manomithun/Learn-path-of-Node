The old town slept under a sky of rust.

Its streets curled like ribbons through fog.

At the center stood a crooked clock tower.

And inside it, an even more crooked man.

Mr. Elric, the clockmaker.

He hadn’t left in forty years.

Not once.

Locals whispered stories about him.

That he didn’t age.

That he spoke to the gears.

Every night, the tower chimed on the hour.

Not a second off.

Rain or shine.

Until one Thursday… it didn’t.

The town noticed.

And grew restless.

As if their hearts stopped ticking too.

Nobody dared enter.

Except Clara.

A curious girl with brass in her pocket.

She climbed the spiral stairs.

Dust coughed from the walls.

The ticking grew louder.

And stranger.

Like it was… breathing.

“Mr. Elric?” she called.

No answer.

Just tick… tick…

…talk.

She blinked.

A door opened by itself.

Inside: a thousand clocks, ticking in rhythm.

All different.

None broken.

One stood out.

A clock shaped like a heart.

It wasn’t ticking.

And beside it, Mr. Elric.

Eyes closed.

Hands still turning a gear.

“He’s gone,” Clara whispered.

But the room disagreed.

The clocks echoed with life.

She stepped closer.

His fingers twitched.

Not dead.

Just paused.

On the wall behind him:

A blueprint.

Of the entire town.

With moving parts.

Houses, chimneys, dogs.

All turning like clockwork.

Clara gasped.

“He built this?”

The blueprint pulsed once.

Then again.

A clock behind her rang midnight.

All the clocks stopped.

Except one.

The heart-clock.

Tick.

Tick.

Slowly.

Then faster.

Mr. Elric opened his eyes.

Pale blue, like frosted glass.

“You touched it.”

Clara stepped back.

“I-I didn’t mean to—”

“No,” he said.

“You were meant to.”

He stood, bones creaking like old wood.

“I’m tired.”

He handed her the winding key.

“It’s your turn.”

“To fix clocks?”

“To keep time alive.”

The blueprint reformed itself.

Clara’s house appeared on it.

A small version of her waved.

She dropped the key.

“Is this real?”

Elric smiled.

“What is, anymore?”

He stepped into the wall.

And vanished.

The clocks began again.

With Clara at the center.

Winding. Watching. Waiting.

Time flowed through her fingers.

The tower breathed again.

Outside, the town woke refreshed.

No one noticed Elric was gone.

But they smiled more.

Slept easier.

And the clock never stopped again.

Clara never left.

But she was never alone.

Because time remembers its keeper.
